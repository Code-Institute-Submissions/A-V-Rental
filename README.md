## UX
### Project Goals

The aim of the A&V website is to creat a fast and secure way for clients to connect with Arthur and Vernon Inc.
and be able to have access to the available services and offers that A&V provides.

### Customer Needs 

The potential clients in mind when creating this website was, people who travle alot, or enviromentally 
concscience residance of the city that the A&V vendor is located at that prefer car-pooling.

Needs in mind were:
-Offering affordable rates.
-Large selection of cars.
-Veriety of makes and models, including fuel, eg. petrol, gasoline, or electric.
-Demonstration of ease of access to local dealer and garages.
-Demonstration of local of the dealerships to make it easier for clients to pick up and drop off the rentals.

### Creator Goals

-Developing a resposive website with the least amount of clutter to ease navigation.
-Straight forward programming of the website to make it clear what the vendor has to offer.
-Easy to read text and sentences explaining why A&V is a good option.
-A task that inspires the developer and makes the job enjoable.

### Customer Stories

If I was a potential client I would like the website to:
-Make it clear and intuitive how to nagivigate and make use of.
-Have clear options that guide me through the proccess of making use of the services.
-Be Visually apealing and have good layouts and color codes.
-Make it easy to get in touch with a person and state questions or concerns, e.g phone numbers and addresses.


### Design picks 

The design of the logo is an imalgamation of A and V with an artistic twist! I feel like it will stick in the 
client's mind once they understand the refrence of the logo.

The design of the website itself; for example the coloring and shades was made to make the 
visitor feel welcome, and the dark theme to make it easy on the eye and creat a feeling of relaxation. 
I feel like the mix of black and blue brings about calmness and trust. So the buttons and overall
theme were centered around that.

The logos on the home-page were put there as a refrence to makes and models which are well known, and draws the 
visitor in.
